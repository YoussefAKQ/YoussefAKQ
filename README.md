## Hello! I'm Youssef. <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="35" />
I'm 21 years old and a software development student 🐣. Currently, I'm in my second year of an advanced degree in Application Development in Madrid, Spain.

In my first year, I studied SQL with MySQL, Java in Eclipse, Python in IDLE, Linux with VirtualBox, HTML, CSS, XML, and gained exposure to Oracle DB, among other topics. In my second year, I’ve studied Visual Basic .NET, Java in Android Studio, Data Access with Java, Odoo on AWS, Python, video game development with libGDX in Java, and much more.

Additionally, I’ve self-studied JavaScript, React Native, Tailwind, Git, Next.js and Supabase to further expand my skill set.

Currently, I'm doing an internship as a Junior Software Developer, where I've seen PHP CodeIgniter 4, Python AI Oriented (RAG, ChromaDB, Chatbot, OpenAI API, Ollama) and I'm currently training, and working with React, Python, Git, Supabase and more.
