## Hello! I'm Youssef. <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="35" />
I'm 20 years old and a software development student 🐣. Currently, I’m in my second year of an advanced degree in Application Development in Madrid, Spain.

During my first year, I studied SQL with MySQL, Java in Eclipse, Python in IDLE, Linux with VirtualBox, HTML, CSS, XML, and gained some exposure to Oracle DB, among other topics.
In my second year, I’m focusing on Visual Basic .NET, Java in Android Studio, Data Access with Java, Odoo on AWS, Python and much more.

Additionally, I’m self-studying JavaScript, React Native, TailWind, Git and Next.js to expand my skill set.
